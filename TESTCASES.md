This file contains the details of what was added by me to make the test cases from automationexercise.com more complex.

# General changes

Every test case(TC) has the same first 3 steps: "Launch browser, Navigate to url 'http://automationexercise.com', Verify that home page is visible successfully"
Browser launch and URL navigation have been added as the "@Begin" method for each TC. "As for Verify that home page is visible successfully", it's been replaced with "Verify that logo is visible" as there are no specifications to how exactly we should check that the page is visible. That's why I'm just checking the general element to be visible instead.
